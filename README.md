# Analysis and computation of DV and CV-QKD information rates

This repository contains the code used in "Analysis and computation of DV and CV-QKD information rates", project done during the course of Information Theory @ Politecnico di Milano.

## Scope

The scope of this project is calculate the mutual information and qubit error rate of the BB02 continuos variable quantum key distribution. </br>
Details on theory and results are present in the report.

## Code Structure

To plot symbol constellation and check:</br>  QAM_QKD_symbol_constellation.m </br>

To compute channel capacity and QBER: </br> QAM_QKD_channel_capacity_plots.m
